    ```

Run the program:
Run the compiled program to interact with the visualization.

    ```bash
    ./sorting-visualization
    ```

#Usage

Upon running the program, you'll be presented with an introductory screen and a list of available sorting algorithms.
Choose a sorting algorithm by entering its corresponding number.
The visualization will start, showing each step of the sorting process graphically.
Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the visualization.
